    <dt><b>Acronyms, Use of Periods</b></dt>
      <dd>Periods are used in acronyms (<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;N.A.F.T.A.&rdquo; &mdash; not &ldquo;NAFTA&rdquo; or &ldquo;Nafta&rdquo;). So: 
        <blockquote>
          N.A.F.T.A.
          <br>
          <b>Not:</b> NAFTA or Nafta
        </blockquote>
        The reason for this is signal to the reader that what they are reading is, in fact, an acronym, as opposed to a word in all capital letters or a proper noun (though, many things represented by acronyms are, to be sure, also proper nouns). No additional period is added if the acronym is the last item in a sentence.  As far as we are aware, the <i>New York Times</i> is one of the only major newspapers that also uses periods in acronyms.</dd>
