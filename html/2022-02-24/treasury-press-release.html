  <h1>U.S. Treasury Targets Belarusian Support for Russian Invasion of Ukraine</h1>
  <p>February 24, 2022</p>
  <p>WASHINGTON &ndash; As part of the United States&rsquo; serious and expansive response to Russia&rsquo;s further invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is sanctioning 24 Belarusian individuals and entities due to Belarus&rsquo;s support for, and facilitation of, the invasion. Today&rsquo;s action focuses on Belarus&rsquo;s defense sector and financial institutions, two areas in which Belarus has especially close ties to Russia. Belarus has become increasingly reliant on Russia for economic, political, and military support in recent years as the regime has clung to power following the fraudulent August 2020 presidential election.</p>
  <p>Treasury&rsquo;s Russia-related actions will also have significant downstream effects in Belarus. The Belarusian economy is highly dependent on key Russian financial institutions and their subsidiaries, including Public Joint Stock Company Sberbank of Russia (Sberbank), VTB Bank Public Joint Stock Company (VTB), and State Corporation Bank for Development and Foreign Economic Affairs Vnesheconombank (VEB). Restrictions against Sberbank, VTB, and VEB, combined with the measures against Belarusian banks, target nearly one-fifth of the country&rsquo;s entire financial sector.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Having already sacrificed its legitimacy to suppress the democratic aspirations of the Belarusian people, the Lukashenka regime is now jeopardizing Belarus&rsquo;s sovereignty by supporting Russia&rsquo;s further invasion of Ukraine,&rdquo; said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. &ldquo;Treasury continues to disrupt Belarus&rsquo;s military and financial capabilities through targeted sanctions. Further, due to the interconnectedness between the two countries, the actions Treasury took against Russia today will also impose severe economic pain on the Lukashenka regime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Today&rsquo;s actions follow five previous Belarus-related sanctions tranches by the United States and its allies in response to the degradation of democracy in Belarus. The Lukashenka regime has continued to erode democracy in Belarus and has become increasingly subservient to Russia in the process. Proposed amendments to the Belarusian constitution will exacerbate that trend and will pave the way for increased Russian influence in Minsk.</p>
  
  <h2>BELARUSIAN STATE-OWNED BANKS</h2>
  <p>Today, OFAC is designating two significant state-owned banks that are among the most important banks in Belarus. The Belarus banking sector is highly concentrated, with state-owned banks directly or indirectly financing or conducting activity on behalf of the Government of Belarus (GoB). Sanctioning these two GoB-owned banks, in addition to Russia-related restrictions imposed on three other systemically important Belarusian financial institutions, means that a significant portion of the Belarusian financial sector is now subject to U.S. sanctions.</p>
  <p><b>Belarussian Bank of Development and Reconstruction Belinvestbank Joint Stock Company</b> (Belinvestbank) is the fourth largest financial institution in Belarus. Belinvestbank is being designated pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14038 for being owned or controlled by, or for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the GoB. Additionally, two Minsk-based companies, real estate firm <b>Limited Liability Company Belinvest-Engineering</b> and financial leasing company <b>CJSC Belbizneslizing</b>, are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14038 for being owned or controlled by, or for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Belinvestbank.</p>
  <p><b>Bank Dabrabyt Joint-Stock Company</b> (Bank Dabrabyt) is the eleventh largest financial institution in Belarus. Prior to the GoB&rsquo;s purchase of the bank&rsquo;s controlling shares in 2014, it was known as Bank Moscow Minsk JSC. Bank Dabrabyt is being designated pursuant to E.O. 14038 for being owned or controlled by, or for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the GoB.</p>
  <p>Concurrently, OFAC is issuing Belarus General Licenses 6 and 7 to authorize certain transactions related to the official business of the U.S. government and international organizations and entities, respectively.</p>

  <h2>BELARUSIAN DEFENSE AND SECURITY INDUSTRIES</h2>
  <p>The Belarusian defense industry is closely linked to Russia. For example, Russia relies on Belarusian components for several ongoing strategic projects. In an effort to address the destabilizing behavior of the Belarusian Armed Forces and its facilitation of Russia&rsquo;s continued violations of Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty, OFAC is taking further action against the defense and related materiel sector of the Belarus economy. The entities and individuals sanctioned today build on OFAC&rsquo;s December 2021 designation of Belarusian defense firms to further disrupt this critical sector.</p>
