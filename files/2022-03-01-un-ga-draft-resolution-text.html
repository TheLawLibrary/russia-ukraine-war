    <p><i>The General Assembly,</i></p>
    <p><i>Reaffirming</i> the paramount importance of the Charter of the United Nations in the promotion of the rule of law among nations,</p>
    <p><i>Recalling</i> the obligation of all States under Article 2 of the Charter to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, and to settle their international disputes by peaceful means,</p>
    <p><i>Recalling also</i> the obligation under Article 2 (2) of the Charter, that all Members, in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from membership, shall fulfil in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the Charter,</p>
    <p><b>[PAGE 2]</b></p>
    <p><i>Taking note</i> of Security Council resolution 2623 (2022) of 27 February 2022, in which the Council called for an emergency special session of the General Assembly to examine the question contained in document S/Agenda/8979,</p>
    <p><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 377 A (V) of 3 November 1950, entitled “Uniting for peace”, and taking into account that the lack of unanimity of the permanent members of the Security Council at its 8979th meeting has prevented it from exercising its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security,</p>
    <p><i>Recalling also</i> its resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, in which it approved the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, and reaffirming the principles contained therein that the territory of a State shall not be the object of acquisition by another State resulting from the threat or use of force, and that any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and territorial integrity of a State or country or at its political independence is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter,</p>
    <p><i>Recalling further</i> its resolution 3314 (XXIX) of 14 December 1974, which defines aggression as the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter,</p>
    <p><i>Bearing in mind</i> the importance of maintaining and strengthening international peace founded upon freedom, equality, justice and respect for human rights and of developing friendly relations among nations irrespective of their political, economic and social systems or the levels of their development,</p>
    <p><i>Recalling</i> the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, signed in Helsinki on 1 August 1975, and the Memorandum on Security Assurances in Connection with Ukraine’s Accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (Budapest Memorandum) of 5 December 1994,</p>
    <p><i>Condemning</i> the 24 February 2022 declaration by the Russian Federation of a &ldquo;special military operation&rdquo; in Ukraine,</p>
    <p><i>Reaffirming</i> that no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal,</p>
    <p><i>Expressing grave concern</i> at reports of attacks on civilian facilities such as residences, schools and hospitals, and of civilian casualties, including women, older persons, persons with disabilities, and children,</p>
    <p><i>Recognizing</i> that the military operations of the Russian Federation inside the sovereign territory of Ukraine are on a scale that the international community has not seen in Europe in decades and that urgent action is needed to save this generation from the scourge of war,</p>
    <p><i>Endorsing</i> the Secretary-General’s statement of 24 February 2022 in which he recalled that the use of force by one country against another is the repudiation of the principles that every country has committed to uphold and that the present military offensive of the Russian Federation is against the Charter,</p>
    <p><i>Condemning</i> the decision of the Russian Federation to increase the readiness of its nuclear forces,</p>
    <p><i>Expressing grave concern</i> at the deteriorating humanitarian situation in and around Ukraine, with an increasing number of internally displaced persons and refugees in need of humanitarian assistance,</p>
    <p><b>[PAGE 3]</b></p>
    <p><i>Expressing concern also</i> about the potential impact of the conflict on increased food insecurity globally, as Ukraine and the region are one of the world’s most important areas for grain and agricultural exports, when millions of people are facing famine or the immediate risk of famine or are experiencing severe food insecurity in several regions of the world, as well as on energy security,</p>
    <p><i>Welcoming</i> the continued efforts by the Secretary-General and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and other international and regional organizations to support de-escalation of the situation with respect to Ukraine, and encouraging continued dialogue,</p>

    <p>10. <i>Deplores</i> the involvement of Belarus in this unlawful use of force against Ukraine, and calls upon it to abide by its international obligations;</p>
    <p>11. <i>Condemns</i> all violations of international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights, and calls upon all parties to respect strictly the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ffn2">2</a></sup> and Additional Protocol I thereto of 1977,<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ffn3">3</a></sup> as applicable, and to respect international human rights law, and in this regard further demands that all parties <b>[PAGE 4]</b> ensure respect for and the protection of all medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of transport and equipment, as well as hospitals and other medical facilities;</p>
    <p>12. <i>Demands</i> that all parties fully comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law to spare the civilian population, and civilian objects, refraining from attacking, destroying, removing or rendering useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, and respecting and protecting humanitarian personnel and consignments used for humanitarian relief operations;</p>
    <p>13. <i>Requests</i> the Emergency Relief Coordinator to provide, 30 days after the adoption of the present resolution, a report on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine and on the humanitarian response;</p>
