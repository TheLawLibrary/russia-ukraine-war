    <h1>How to Read Citations</h1>
      <p class="indent_1">The goal in compiling these resources has been to ensure durable copies of the resources are accessible in perpetuity. Accordingly, at the end of each citation, there are various letter designations within brackets. These letters signify the information medium to which the letter is linked.</p>
          <p class="indent_1">Legend:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none;" class="indent_2">
              <li>O = Original. This is a link to the original Internet source.</li>
              <li>IA = Intenet Archive. This is a link to an archived version of the original Internet source hosted on the Internet Archive&rsquo;s Wayback Machine (archive.org)</li>
              <li>AT = Archive Today. This is a link to an archived version of the original Internet source hosted on Archive Today. The web address of Archive Today has changed over time. Initially <a href="https://www.archive.is">archive.is</a>, the Archive Today homepage can now be accessed with either <a href="https://www.archive.ph">archive.ph</a> or <a href="https://www.archive.today">archive.today</a>. Even when archiving webpages on the archive.today domain, the archived webpages will be saved on the archive.ph domain. NOTE: PDF documents are not able to be archived on archive.today. If the original webpage is is a PDF document, then it will only be archived on the Internet Archive and as a Local PDF.</li>
